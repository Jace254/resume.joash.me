# Resume

You can check out my Resume [here](https://resume.joash.me).


## How it works

- The data is hosted by [Gist](https://gist.github.com/Jace254/f09113ec7cb9f2900ff783a2475d7c34) with [JSON Resume](https://jsonresume.org/) standard.
- The website is hosted by [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) with CI/CD.
- HTML is generated with [Handlebars](https://handlebarsjs.com/) and PDF is printed with [puppeteer](https://github.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/).
